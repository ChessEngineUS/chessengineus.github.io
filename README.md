Happy Mother's Day!
This for all of the moms in the world, it's a very basic program, it just is a basic file that can be downloaded and run locally. 
Since I made this to be accesible to anyone, I will lay out how to run this locally. 
If there are any issues, go to the "Issues" section and post them and I will answer them for you.
If you have any recommendations or additions, you can either put it in the "Issues" section 
or in the "Pull Requests" section if you're more technologically inclined.
As a quick note, anywhere I say click, it may require a double click for some users.
Here are the steps:
1. Go to the main section of this project, or click this link: https://github.com/ChessEngineUS/chessengineus.github.io
2. Click on the green button towards the top right that says "<>Code".
3. By default, you should be in the "Local" section. If not, navigate there by clicking the left hand side of the dropdown menu.
4. Click "Download ZIP".
5. If you are using Chrome as your browser, a download arrow will appear in the top right corner. Click on it.
6. If you are not using Chrome, in your system search bar, search for "File Explorer". Click "Open".
7. Once you have done so, look for the "Downloads" section on the lefthand side of the screen.
8. On top of this section should be the file "chessengineus.github.io-main.zip". Click on it.
9. On the top of your screen will appear the option to "Extract all". Do not worry about naming the file, just click extract.
10. A new window should open with the extracted file. If for some reason it doesn't, navigate to the "Downloads" section.
11. The file should be called "chessengineus.github.io-main". Click on it. You may need to double click.
12. Click on the only folder called "mother's day 2023 test 2". Once again, you may need to double click.
13. Click on the file called "index".
14. It should open a window in microsoft edge, click on the button "Click for Affirmation". 
15. It randomly gives one of thirty-one possible responses at this time of this writing. 
16. It will include more possible messages as time goes on.

Use this whenever you or your mom wants! Enjoy!
Thank you for downloading. I will hopefully periodically make it a more sophisticated website, but for now, I hope this is sufficient.
I am working on making this a publicly available website with a simple link, but many include cost on my part.
This would mean I would have to charge people to pay for this, but I want to make this free and acessible to everyone.
At some point it will become a publicaly available website and this README file will indicate so. I
In the meantime the above process will allow you to have the file, make edits if you know basic, programming, and run the program locally.
Thank you!
